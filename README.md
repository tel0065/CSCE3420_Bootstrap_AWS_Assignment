# CSCE3420_Bootstrap_AWS_Assignment
UNT CSCE 3420 Week 9 Assignment - Create and Host a Static Webpage

This week you are going to create a Bootstrap based website, put it in your GitHub (or AWS CodeCommit) repository, and then host it on Amazon Web Services.

For clarification, Git(Hub) and AWS CodeCommit are basically the same service (providing Git repositories). GitHub pages and AWS Amplify are basically the same service (for hosting webpages). You can use either GitHub or CodeCommit, but please follow the tutorial and use AWS Amplify instead of GitHub pages for hosting your site.

I just downloaded the Bootstrap files (https://getbootstrap.com/), and moved them to my GitHub repository along with a Bootstrap example file (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) (please use any example that you like or create your own). I had to change a few paths in the example file for the /css and /js folders. Feel free to get as fancy as you like, or use this as your personal webpage or a page to show off your portfolio for work. You need to include an image in the page somewhere and modify the text of the site to remove the boilerplate and make it more personal. Your site should also look nice - if it looks like the css is not working, check the path to your /css folder in your example's "index.html" file.

If you want to add a fancy template to your site to make it look really nice, check out the templates here (https://startbootstrap.com/).

Once your site is modified and in your repository, follow the steps to host it here (https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/host-static-website/). You already have a repository, so you don't need to follow the instructions in the tutorial to create a new one. I didn't need to alter the default build settings.

Now, when you commit any changes to GitHub, they will appear on your site. (It takes a minute or two for Amplify to re-verify the code). Also, check out the 'Learn to Get the Most Out of Amplify Console' drop down to see other things that you can do with the Git / Amplify link.

In the amplify console, you will see a link to your site (probably on amplifyapp.com). This is the link you will submit for the assignment.
